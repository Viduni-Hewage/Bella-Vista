## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bella-vista.git
cd bella-vista
```
2. Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```
3. Install backend dependencies:
```bash
cd ../backend
npm install
```
### Environment Variables

Create `.env` files for frontend and backend:

   - **Frontend `.env`:**
     ```bash
     VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-auth0-domain
     VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-auth0-client-id
     VITE_AUTH0_AUDIENCE=your-api-audience
     VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
     ```

   - **Backend `.env`:**
     ```bash
     MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
     JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
     PORT=5000
     CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
     AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-auth0-domain
     AUTH0_AUDIENCE=your-api-audience
     M2M_CLIENT_ID=your-m2m-client-id
     M2M_CLIENT_SECRET=your-m2m-client-secret
     ```

## Usage
1. Start the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```
2. Start the frontend server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
3. Open the application in the browser
```bash
http://localhost:5173
```
### Security & Environment Setup
- Authentication
     - Auth0 handles user login, registration, and roles
     - JWT tokens verify sessions between frontend and backend

- Security Practices
     - Store sensitive keys in .env files (JWT_SECRET, MongoDB URI, Auth0 client ID/secret)
     - Secure API routes with JWT verification
     - Restrict CORS to frontend origin
     - Sanitize user input in backend to prevent injection attacks

## Future Enhancements

- Add multiple payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal).

- Implement product reviews and ratings.

- Add personalized product recommendations.

- Enhance admin dashboard with additional management features.
